                        When Maria moved abroad for work, her 78-year-old grandmother, Lola Rosa, refused to learn smartphones.
                        <br>
                        Letters became their lifeline—but postal delays made Maria miss birthdays and holidays. With Courier,

                        Maria now drafts letters on her phone during lunch breaks. Lola Rosa receives them in handwritten-style

                        print within days, complete with Maria’s scanned doodles of their old cat. One morning, Lola Rosa opened
                        <br>
                        her door to find a Courier envelope with a single line: "I love you"—typed by Maria but delivered like a
                        <br>
                        hug. That night, Lola left a voicemail: "Your ‘text’ arrived. Write me again tomorrow."

                        Deployed in a remote base with spotty internet, Jake relied on Courier to send
                        <br>
                        encrypted letters to his wife, Emma. The app’s military-grade security ensured

                        his messages about their unborn child stayed private. One letter, marked
                        <br>
                        "Open when the baby kicks," arrived as Emma felt the first flutter.
                        <br>
                        Inside was a folded ultrasound image Jake had uploaded digitally,
                        <br>
                        now printed alongside his vow: "I’ll read to them every night—even
                        <br>
                        through these letters." When Jake finally held his daughter, she

                        recognized his voice from the Courier letters Emma had read aloud.

                    <br>
                        After losing his brother, David couldn’t bring himself to delete their old texts.
                        <br>
                        His therapist suggested writing letters to process his guilt over unsaid words.
                        <br>
                        But David’s hands shook too much to hold a pen. With Courier, he typed raw,
                        <br>
                        rambling notes—auto-formatted into elegant stationery—and sent them to his
                        <br>
                        own address. One day, he accidentally addressed a letter to his brother’s
                        <br>
                        old home. The new tenant, an elderly man, replied via Courier:
                        <br>
                        "Your words found me. I lost a sister too. Keep writing."
                        <br>
                        Their unexpected pen-pal friendship became David’s
                        <br>
                        bridge back to healing.
